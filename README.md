This is a repository for my website, codedbyclark.com
Everything for this repo is done for the Udemy class
"The Complete Web Develop Course: Build 14 Websites" By Rob Percival

It is my intention to eventually have this website up, purchased through the Eco Web Hosting,
and advertising my projects and such.

Software used:
Komodo Edit 8 & Atom (I like this editor better and am using exclusively now)
FileZilla
SourceTree for Git Management (Also using iTerm)
